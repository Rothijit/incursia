        <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 26th November, 2025</p>

        <h4>1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>Incursia ("We", "Us", "Our", or "The Service") is a Discord bot application designed for entertainment, economy, and gaming purposes. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.</p>
        <p>By inviting, installing, or using Incursia, you agree to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h4>2. DATA WE COLLECT</h4>
        <p>To provide our services (such as saving your game progress, inventory, and balance), we collect specific information from your Discord account and your interactions with the bot.</p>

        <p><strong>A. Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
        <p>When you interact with the Service, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord User ID:</strong> A unique numerical identifier used to associate your save file, inventory, and stats with your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Discord Username & Discriminator:</strong> To display your name on leaderboards, profiles, and game messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Server (Guild) ID:</strong> To manage server-specific settings (e.g., prefixes, spawn channels).</li>
            <li><strong>Channel ID:</strong> To know where to send responses and spawn game events.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>B. Game & Usage Data</strong></p>
        <p>We generate and store data related to your gameplay, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Virtual Assets:</strong> Inventories (cards, characters, items), currency balances, and experience points (EXP).</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Win/loss records, command usage history, and vote streaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction History:</strong> Logs of trades between users (to prevent fraud and enforce our Terms of Service).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>C. Message Content</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Command Processing:</strong> We process the text content of messages starting with our prefix (e.g., !, /) to execute commands.</li>
            <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> We do not permanently store your message content (chat logs) unless you voluntarily submit it via a Feedback or Bug Report command.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</h4>
        <p>We use the collected information solely for the operation and improvement of the Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Gameplay:</strong> To maintain your persistent save file (e.g., ensuring you don't lose your coins or items when the bot restarts).</li>
            <li><strong>Service Customization:</strong> To remember your preferences (e.g., turned-off notifications, custom prefixes).</li>
            <li><strong>Security & Enforcement:</strong> To detect cheating, macro usage, and "alt-farming" in violation of our Terms of Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To monitor bot performance, server growth, and feature popularity (using aggregated, non-personally identifiable data).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. DATA SHARING & THIRD PARTIES</h4>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. However, data may be processed by trusted third-party services essential for our operation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hosting Providers:</strong> (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku) where our databases and application code are hosted.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Services:</strong> (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) used to store your game data securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Vote Aggregators:</strong> (e.g., Top.gg) which may receive your User ID to validate vote rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to enforce our Terms of Service (e.g., reporting severe abuse to Discord Trust & Safety).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. DATA RETENTION</h4>
        <p>We retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide the Service to you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Accounts:</strong> Your game data is kept indefinitely while you are an active user.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> We reserve the right to delete data from users who have not interacted with the Service for a significant period (e.g., 365 days) to optimize database performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>6. YOUR RIGHTS & DATA REMOVAL</h4>
        <p>You have the right to control your data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can view most of your stored data by using the bot’s profile or statistics commands (e.g., /profile, /stats).</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> You may request the permanent deletion of all data associated with your Discord User ID.</li>
            <li><strong>To Request Deletion:</strong> Please contact us via our Support Server or email <code>incursia.discord.bot@gmail.com</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Deletion is permanent and irreversible. You will lose all game progress, items, and currency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h4>
        <p>The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the legal age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.</p>

        <h4>8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h4>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be announced via the bot or our official Support Server. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
